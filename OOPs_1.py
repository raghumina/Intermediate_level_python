# Classes and Objects in python
# Object Oriented Programming is a way of computer programming
# using the idea of “objects” to represents data and methods.
# A class is a collection of objects or you can say it is a blueprint of objects defining
# the common attributes and behavior.
# Now the question arises, how do you do that?

# Now lets create a class

class student :


    def func(self):
        print("hello")

obj = student()
print(obj.func())
